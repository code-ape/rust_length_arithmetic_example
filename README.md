# Rust Length Arithmetic Example

This repo holds the code related to my article on creating an arithmetic system for lengths in Rust to guarantee safety and correctness of computation along with clean code without adding overhead. To read the article please visit:
[ferrisellis.com/posts/rust-implementing-units-for-types/](ferrisellis.com/posts/rust-implementing-units-for-types/)

This code was tested on Rustc 1.15.1 stable.

To run this code do:

```bash
rustc example.rs
./example
```
